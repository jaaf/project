extract with approx. 75% extract, a golden-brown
color and a fine, sweet malt aroma.
Weyermann® malt extract Bavarian Pilsner is made from
high-quality Weyermann® Pilsner malt and Weyermann®
CARAPILS®. For the production, a traditional mash pre-
paration and wort boiling is carried out according to the
beer type. The authentic beer wort produced in this way
is clarified before evaporation by means of a high-
performance centrifuge. After evaporation, an aseptic
hot filling takes place in container sizes from 4 kg to
1200 kg.
The desired wort gravity can be achieved by means of
dilution with brewing water. Weyermann® dilution guideli-
nes are available below under Downloads.
Weyermann® malt extracts can be combined with all hop
products. The duration of the wort boiling depends on
the isomerization time of the hop products used and the
desired bitterness.
Adjusted to the typical original gravity wort, the
Weyermann® Bavarian Pilsner malt extract corresponds
to a traditional German Pilsner in taste and visual appea-
rance.
Through the individual selection of hops, yeast and
fermentation adapted to the beer type, various beer
styles can be brewed, such as:
• Pale Lagers; American (Light) Lager,
International Pale Lager, Munich Helles,
Festbier, German Leichtbier, Kellerbier
(Pale Kellerbier), India Pale Lager
• Pilsener; German Pilsener, American Pilsener,
Czech Pilsener
• Strong Lager; Imperial Pilsener
• Bock; Helles Bock, Helles Doppelbock
• Pale Ale; Summer Ale
• IPA; American IPA, Juicy IPA, Hazy IPA,
NEIPA, Double IPA
• Strong Ale; Belgian Golden Strong Ale
For Krausen dosage prior to secondary fermentation or
for bottle fermentation very well suited.
Also well suited for original gravity correction at the end
of wort boiling.
All Weyermann® malt extracts can be combined with
each other, as well as with Weyermann® Sinamar®, for

malt extract with approx. 75% extract, a golden-
brown color and a fine, sweet malt aroma.
Weyermann® malt extract Bavarian Maibock is made
from high-quality Weyermann® Vienna malt and a
portion of Weyermann® CARAPILS® and Weyermann®
CARARED®.
For the production, a traditional mash preparation and
wort boiling is carried out according to the beer type.
The authentic beer wort produced in this way is clarified
before evaporation by means of a high-performance
centrifuge. After evaporation, an aseptic hot filling takes
place in container sizes from 4 kg to 1200 kg.
The desired wort gravity can be achieved by means of
dilution with brewing water. Weyermann® dilution guide-
lines are available below under Downloads.
Weyermann® malt extracts can be combined with all
hop products. The duration of the wort boiling depends
on the isomerization time of the hop products used and
the desired bitterness.
Adjusted to the corresponding wort, the Weyermann®
Maibock malt extract corresponds to a traditional Ger-
man Maibock in taste and visual appearance.
Through the individual selection of hops, yeast and
fermentation, adapted to the beer type, various
beer styles can be brewed, such as:
• Bock; Dark Bock, Double Bock
• Wheat Beer; Dunkel Weizen, Weizenbock
• IPA; Red IPA
• Amber Ale; Altbier
• Strong Ale; American Barley Wine, Imperial Red Ale
Very well suited for Krausen dosage prior to secondary
fermentation or for bottle fermentation.
Also, very well suited for original gravity correction at
the end of wort boiling.
All Weyermann® malt extracts can be combined with
each other, as well as with Weyermann® SINAMAR®,
for more individual recipe creations.
